Metadata can refer to granular context, such as section type, or to more global context, such as unique document ids. Reliance on metadata for contextualized representation learning is apropos in the clinical domain where text is semi-structured and expresses high variation in topics. We evaluate the LMC model on the task of zero-shot clinical acronym expansion across three datasets. The LMC significantly outperforms a diverse set of baselines at a fraction of the pre-training cost and learns clinically coherent representations. We demonstrate that not only is metadata itself very helpful for the task, but that the LMC inference algorithm provides an additional large benefit.}

    pages = {41-52},
    abstract = {Estimating the effect of a given medical treatment on individual patients involves evaluating how clinical outcomes are affected by the treatment in question. Robust estimates of the treatment effect for a given patient with a prespecified set of clinical characteristics, are possible to obtain when there is sufficient common support for these features. Essentially, features having the greatest common support correspond to regions of significant overlap between the distributions of the different treatment groups. In observational datasets, however, all possible treatment options may not be uniformly represented, and therefore robust estimation of their effect may only be possible for the patients in the overlapping region. In this work, we propose a Contrastive Variational Autoencoder (ContrastiveVAE) to estimate where there is significant overlap between patient distributions corresponding to different treatment options. A Contrastive-VAE exploits shared information between different groups by modeling the shared information as arising from a shared set of latent variables to approximate distributions for treatment options that are not well represented in observational datasets. The result is an improved estimation of the distribution of the groups with a small number of data points. By estimating the likelihood for each group with annealed importance sampling, we are able to quantitatively identify the area of overlap between multiple treatment groups and obtain an effective confidence interval for the estimated individual treatment effect.}

Our Bayesian formalism is essential in (a) flexibly combining these heterogeneous data sources and their corresponding levels of uncertainty, (b) quantifying the degree of confidence associated with a given diagnostic, and (c) dealing with the missing values that typically plague medical data. We quantify the potential of this approach on simulated data, and showcase its practicality by deploying it on a real COVID19 immunity study.}

However, EHRs are challenging to model due to their realisation as noisy, multi-modal data occurring at irregular time intervals. To address their temporal nature, we treat EHRs as samples generated by a Temporal Point Process (TPP), enabling us to model what happened in an event with when it happened in a principled way. We gather and propose neural network parameterisations of TPPs, collectively referred to as Neural TPPs. We perform evaluations on synthetic EHRs as well as on a set of established benchmarks. We show that TPPs significantly outperform their non-TPP counterparts on EHRs. We also show that an assumption of many Neural TPPs, that the class distribution is conditionally independent of time, reduces performance on EHRs. Finally, our proposed attention-based Neural TPP performs favourably compared to existing models, whilst aligning with real world interpretability requirements, an important step towards a component of clinical decision support systems.}

Our classification accuracy significantly surpassed state-of-the-art studies. The result suggests that free talk has stronger classification power than standard speech tasks, which could help the design of future speech tasks for efficient early diagnosis of the disease.

To date, how best to construct such states in a healthcare setting is an open question. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of several information encoding architectures using data from septic patients in the MIMIC-III dataset to form representations of a patient state. We evaluate the impact of representation dimension, correlations with established acuity scores, and the treatment policies derived from them. We find that sequentially formed state representations facilitate effective policy learning in batch settings, validating a more thoughtful approach to representation learning that remains faithful to the sequential and partial nature of healthcare data.}

    abstract = {Abbreviation expansion is an important problem in clinical natural language processing because abbreviations often occur in text notes in medical records, and expansions of these abbreviations are critical for downstream applications such as assistive diagnosis and insurance code review. Previous studies have treated abbreviation expansion as a special case of word sense disambiguation; however, abbreviation expansion is easier because we only need the character level expansion and not necessarily the full sense of the abbreviation. In particular, such character level expansions may naturally occur elsewhere in medical contexts. Accordingly, we consider two categories of methods for abbreviation expansion: (a) non-sense-based methods that use information solely at lexical levels using state-of-the-art language models, and (b) sense-based methods that also incorporate sense information, such as glosses, from knowledge bases, to simultaneously perform the two tasks of expansion and disambiguation of the abbreviation. We propose two language model based approaches, including a novel length-agnostic permutation language model, find non-sense methods to be more effective than sense-based methods, and achieve the state-of-theart on three clinical datasets.}

Cohen’s kappa coefficient measured the agreement of diagnoses based on different reconstructions.

As a solution, we propose a novel autoencoder-based framework, DeepHeartBeat, to learn human interpretable representations of cardiac cycles from cardiac ultrasound data. Our model encodes high dimensional observations by a cyclic trajectory in a lower dimensional space. We show that the learned parameters describing the latent trajectory are well interpretable and we demonstrate the versatility of our model by successfully applying it to various cardiologically relevant tasks, such as ejection fraction prediction and arrhythmia detection. As a result, DeepHeartBeat promises to serve as a valuable assistant tool for automating therapy decisions and guiding clinical care.}

    abstract = {Quasi-experimental designs allow researchers to determine the effect of a treatment, even when randomized controlled trials are infeasible. A prominent example is interrupted time series (ITS) design, in which the effect of an intervention is determined by comparing the extrapolation of a model trained on data acquired up to moment of intervention, with the interpolation by a model trained on data up to the intervention. Typical approaches for ITS use (segmented) linear regression, and consequently ignore many of the spectral features of time series data. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to ITS, that uses Gaussian process regression and the spectral mixture kernel. This approach can capture more structure of the time series than traditional methods like linear regression or AR(I)MA models, which improves the extrapolation performance, and hence the accuracy of causal inference. We demonstrate our approach in simulations, and use it to determine the causal effect of Kundalini yoga meditation on heart rate oscillations. We show that our approach is able to detect the causal effect of interventions that alter the spectral features of these time series.}

Due to the seriousness of this condition many normal infants and those with benign head shape abnormalities are referred to pediatric craniofacial plastic surgeons, leading to a high referral burden and delays in diagnosis for patients. A diagnostic delay beyond 4 months of age excludes patients from being treated with minimally invasive endoscopic procedures, leading to higher risk open surgeries. Machine learning (ML) image classifiers can enhance the triaging process of these referrals through the use of 3D images taken by a multi-camera & angle setup during patient visits. In doing so, children with synostosis can be identified earlier, qualifying them for less invasive endoscopic surgical intervention. After training a variety of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on 3D images supplemented with synthetic images using generative adversarial networks (GANs), the best-performing model was found to be a novel approach developed in our study called a multi-view collapsed 3D CNN, which achieved area under the receiver operating curves (AUROC) between 90.00-97.00\% for detecting various sub-types of synostosis. These results demonstrate the ability for ML models to potentially streamline the detection of children with synostosis and help overcome challenges associated with high referral burdens for these patients.}

Given fMRI data, the problem of inferring the task, known as task state decoding, is challenging due to the high dimensionality (hundreds of million sampling points per datum) and complex spatio-temporal blood flow patterns inherent in the data. In this work, we propose to tackle the fMRI task state decoding problem by casting it as a 4D spatio-temporal classification problem. We present a novel architecture called Brain Attend and Decode (BAnD), that uses residual convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction and self-attention mechanisms for temporal modeling. We achieve significant performance gain compared to previous works on a 7-task benchmark from the large-scale Human Connectome Project-Young Adult (HCP-YA) dataset. We also investigate the transferability of BAnD’s extracted features on unseen HCP tasks, either by freezing the spatial feature extraction layers and retraining the temporal model, or finetuning the entire model. The pretrained features from BAnD are useful on similar tasks while finetuning them yields competitive results on unseen tasks/conditions.}

Efforts have started worldwide to establish guidelines for evaluating machine learning for health (ML4H) tools, highlighting the necessity to evaluate models for bias, interpretability, robustness, and possible failure modes. However, testing and adopting these guidelines in practice remains an open challenge. In this work, we target the paper-to-practice gap by applying an ML4H audit framework proposed by the ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) to three use cases: diagnostic prediction of diabetic retinopathy, diagnostic prediction of Alzheimer’s disease, and cytomorphologic classification for leukemia diagnostics. The assessment comprises dimensions such as bias, interpretability, and robustness. Our results highlight the importance of fine-grained and caseadapted quality assessment, provide support for incorporating proposed quality assessment considerations of ML4H during the entire development life cycle, and suggest improvements for future ML4H reference evaluation frameworks.}

In this paper, Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), one of the most promising stateof-the-art self-supervised methods, is extensively evaluated on histology data by varying a range of different parameters, including training objective, resolution, and data setup. From the results, we are able to draw important conclusions on the usefulness of CPC for digital pathology. We show strong evidence of the limitations of the learned representation for tumor classification, where only low-level information learned early during training, in the first CPC layers, is used. Furthermore, in our experiments, diversifying the distribution of the dataset (i.e., data from multiple organs or medical centers) does not lead to the model learning a more general representation. This study deepens the understanding of how the CPC model’s objective relates to intrinsic characteristics of histology datasets and will help the development of effective self-supervised methods for histopathology.}

As far as the authors are aware, this work proposes the first deep learning approach for the latter task -- and the second machine learning approach altogether. Additionally, it does so in an interpretable fashion to validate the proposed method for a more wide-spread adoption in healthcare and to potentially unveil unknown epileptic biomarkers. The performance of the Tiny Visual Geometry Group (t-VGG) convolutional neural network is evaluated against Temple University Hospital's \textit{EEG Epilepsy Corpus}, a data set of variable-length EEG recordings gathered during routine checkups.

We conclude that ensembling can be useful to address the class imbalance problem, yet progress can further be accelerated by real-world evaluation setups for benchmarking new methods. }
